# mechanic-website
I've dealt with more than a few bad mechanic websites, so I figured it might be a good project to see if I can make a better one.

This project has been a great opportunity to work on my css skills. I've learned a lot from this, mostly just about design overall but also how to make my own animations. It was really fun for me, and honestly one of the projects I'm most proud of. I tried my hand at some PHP but I'm still using formsubmit to have the forms sent to an email address once filled out. I will be keeping the php file however, just in case I decide i want to use it for a future project.

This site is based on a totally fictional business and totally fictional people, but I tried to make it as realistic as possible with some details and populated it with some realistic information. If you fill out and submit a form, I will most likely not fix your car, but I may E-mail you nonetheless. I don't check this email frequently though, so don't expect a timely response either. If you'd like to ensure a speedy contact, use my personal email address which can be found on my resume.

Thanks for checking this out, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
